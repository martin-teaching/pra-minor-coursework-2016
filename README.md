# Programming Assignments 

Regular coursework assignments are an essential component of any programming course.

I always endeavour to create both challenging and engaging assignments for the students I work with. I aim to achieve the latter by focussing the assignments around contemporary topics, rather than stylistic topics designed specifically for education

You can view an example of some of my assignments in this repository, and other examples of my assignments elsewhere on Github.
